Tribonacci Sequence
****************************************************************************************************************************************************
DESCRIPTION:
****************************************************************************************************************************************************
Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata

[Personal thanks to Professor Jim Fowler on Coursera for his awesome classes that I really recommend to any math enthusiast and for showing me this mathematical curiosity too with his usual contagious passion :)]

// Type your code:
// function tribonacci(signature,n){
function tribonacci(signature,n){
  let n1 = signature[0], n2 = signature[1], n3 = signature[2], nextTerm;
  let result = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result[i] = n1;
    nextTerm = n1 + n2 + n3;
    n1 = n2;
    n2 = n3;
    n3 = nextTerm;
  }
  return result;
}
// Console Log:
console.log(tribonacci([1,1,1], 10)); // [1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,57,105] 

// console.log(tribonacci([1,1,1], 10)); // [1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,57,105]

// Using loop:
/*
function sumTo(n) {
  let sum = 0;

  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}

console.log(sumTo(100));
*/

// Using a recursion, cause sumTo(n) = n + sumTo(n-1) for n > 1:
/*
function sumTo(n) {
  if(n === 1) {
    return n;
  } else {
    return n + sumTo(n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(sumTo(100));
*/

// Fibonacci numbers
/*
function fib(n) {
  return (n <= 1) ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

console.log(fib(7)) // 13
